2,"Data quality indicators are based on the coefficient of variation (CV) and number of observations. Quality indicators indicate the following: A - Excellent (CV between 0% and 2%); B - Very good (CV between 2% and 4%); C - Good (CV between 4% and 8%); D - Acceptable (CV between 8% and 16%); E - Use with caution (CV between 16% and 33.3% )."
3,"Employment income includes wages and salaries before deductions and net self-employment income."
4,"Full-year full-time workers are those who were employed for the whole year (52 weeks) and whose average usual hours of work were 30 or more per week."
5,"Persons aged 16 years and over."
6,"Estimates for Canada do not include the territories."
8,"The Canadian Income Survey (CIS) introduced improvements to the methods and systems used to produce income estimates. Beginning with the 2021 reference year, CIS income data were produced from the Administrative Personal Income Masterfile, a comprehensive source of personal income data generated not only from T1 tax returns, but also from associated tax slips. Previous reference years estimates were produced using T1 tax returns only. Other changes to income processing were introduced at the same time, and estimates for 2021 also incorporated updates to the weighting methodology. These changes to the data source, processing system and weighting improve the quality of the data, while having minimal impact on key CIS estimates and trends."
